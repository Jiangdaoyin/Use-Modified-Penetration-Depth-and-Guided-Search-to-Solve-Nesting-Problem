## Introduction

2D Nesting problem is a kind of combination optimization problem which tragets at maximizing the utilization ratio by arranging the layout of all shapes.

It is a NP-Hard problem and to achieve global optimization is almost impossible. As a result, the most common way to optimize the layout is searching a new better position for polygons step by step.

Guided cuckoo search proposed by Elkeran is the methodology that can obtain the best result by now. This approache applied a elvolution algorithm named cuckoo search to settle searching a new position on a two-dimensional plane. 

However, the searching efficiency is low because

## What we have doneï¼Ÿ 

**We proposed a new methodology based on a modified penetration depth and guided search.**

With this modification, the noncovex searching problem over two-dimensional plane is convert into serval LP problems which can get the best position fast and efficiently under this estimation criteria.

**Based on our current experimental results, our algorithm has gotten layout with higher utilization ratio on serval benchmarks compared with other approaches. Other experiments are in progress.**
